Crabapplehead is a monster from an 80s horror movie.  He enjoys eating crababpples, haunting people and taking naps.
As these needs are met Crabappleheads vital stats fluctuate, as well when user interaction takes place.  There are thresholds
which must be met in order to win.  Remember, Crabiness is a virtue, he is a Crabapplehead after all, so you want that vital sign
to go up.  

Have fun!
